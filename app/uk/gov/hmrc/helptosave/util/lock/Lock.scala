/**
  * This is an `Actor` which handles changing of state when a lock is acquired or a lock
  * is released. On start-up the `Lock` will try to acquire a lock using the given `LockProvider`.
  * If successful `onLockAcquired` is called on the `initialState`. Otherwise `onLockReleased` is
  * called on the `initialState`. The state is updated at this point.  When the lock duration defined
  * in the `LockProvider` has passed this `Actor` will try to acquire/renew a lock again. If successful
  * `onLockAcquired` is called on the current state. Otherwise `onLockReleased` is called on the
  * current state. This continues until the `Actor` dies.
  *
  * The actor will register a release of the lock using the `registerStopHook` function. For Play applications
  * the appropriate function is the `addStopHook` from the injectable `ApplicationLifecycle`. If this release
  * is successful `onLockReleased` is called.
  *
  * N.B.: If the process of trying to acquire/renew a lock fails for any reason the state is not changed.
